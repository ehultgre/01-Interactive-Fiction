You were supposed to head east after passing the convenience store, but it has been some time since you have seen any buildings- or other people, for that matter. As you try to make out your surroundings through the pounding rain, you notice a dark figure walking ahead of you.

[[Walk towards the figure-&gt;Figure]]
[[Investigate the figure-&gt;Bush]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Bush" tags="" position="899,197" size="100,100">You duck behind a bush and begin to observe the stranger, who is soon joined by two other men. Before they are out of earshot, you hear one of them mention that they are looking for someone. &quot;I knew he&#39;d get lost out here&quot; the man says, &quot;but I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d lose him too.&quot; &quot;Maybe he knows theres no store&quot; says one of the others.

[[Flee-&gt;Forest]]
[[Approach the men-&gt;Figure]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Figure" tags="" position="500,198" size="100,100">You approach the figure slowly and anxiously, wary of the type of stranger that you could be meeting on the road at this late hour. As you near the end of your advance you stumble over a stick, alerting the man of your presence. &quot;Its him!&quot; you hear him shout.

[[Flee-&gt;Forest]] 
[[&quot;Me?&quot; you ask the man-&gt;Man]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Forest" tags="" position="700,301" size="100,100">You run through the forest as fast as you can, without looking back. After a few minutes of sprinting you emerge on the side of a dark road, and are greeted by a shout. &quot;You look like you&#39;ve had quite the night!&quot; a man yells at you from the window of a pickup truck. 

[[Ignore the man-&gt;Road]]
[[Approach the truck-&gt;Truck]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Man" tags="" position="299,299" size="100,100">You confusedly walk towards the man, only to be greeted by a flurry of punches. As you gasp for air on the ground you briefly scan the face of your assailant. It is a man you recognize. 

[[Beg for mercy-&gt;Beg]]
[[Fight back-&gt;Fight]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Fight" tags="" position="501,398" size="100,100">&quot;What do you want from me!?&quot; you ask the man as you scramble up to your feet, raising your fists. You ready yourself to attack but it is already too late. Two more men are upon you, and as a bag slips over your head everything fades to black.
[[Game Over]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Beg" tags="" position="99,401" size="100,100">Recognizing the man from the pickup truck ealier you plead, offering him your wallet and possessions in exchange for letting you go. He looks at you with a blank stare, cold and unflinching. &quot;You think I want your wallet?&quot; he asks.
Two more men are upon you, and as a bag slips over your head everything fades to black.
[[Game Over]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Truck" tags="" position="900,399" size="100,100">Visibly exhausted and ragged from running through the woods, you decide to ask the man for directions home. &quot;Go straight until you get to the convenience store&quot; he says, &quot;and then head east.&quot;

[[Walk home-&gt;Road]]
